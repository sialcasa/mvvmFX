/**
 * 
 * This package contains functional interfaces to define accessors of different types.
 * These are used to define a mapping with the {@link de.saxsys.mvvmfx.utils.mapping.ModelWrapper}. 
 * 
 * We need these explicit interfaces to support Java with the type deduction when using method references 
 * of the getter/setter methods of the mapped model class.
